                <hr>
                <p>I have always had an interest in computers and how things work. I really enjoy taking things apart, learning how they work, and then putting them back together.</p>
                <p>After high school, I immediately went to University to try and get my Computer Science degree. I was only able to do 2 years before having to take a break due to degrading mental health.</p>
                <p>I worked for a few years before deciding I was ready to go back, and I was able to get accepted into the Year Up program and finish an internship with X company.</p>
                <p>Now, I hope to be able to push myself to become the best version of myself I can both professionally and personally.</p>
